Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.
Rather than being explicitly programmed, these systems improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more examples.

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishments to teach an agent how to act in an environment.

The main goal of machine learning is to enable systems to make accurate predictions or decisions based on data.
